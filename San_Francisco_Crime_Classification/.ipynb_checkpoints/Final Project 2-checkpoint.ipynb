    "##### With rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay\n",
    "\n",
    "##### My overall summary:\n",
    "By using this dataset, predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city. To keep this project manageable, I've reduced to the number of categories I'm allowed to predict: predict whether the crime will fall under \"LARCENY/THEFT\" or not. One example of how this prediction  could help in the future is to allocate enough law enforcement at the right place and right time to prevent theft. Through some exploratory data analysis (and looking at the test set), I'll keep the columns,\"ID\", \"Dates\", \"Category\", \"PdDistrict\", \"Address\",\"X\", and \"Y\". Overall with the limited amount of columns to work with, with some data minpulation, I think PDdistrict, Dates, X, and Y will have the biggest impact in predictive power."
