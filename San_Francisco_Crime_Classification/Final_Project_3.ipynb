    "##### With rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay\n",
    "\n",
    "##### My overall summary:\n",
    "By using this dataset, predict the category of crime that will occur in the city on the test set. To keep this project manageable, I've reduced to the number of categories I'm allowed to predict: predict whether the crime will fall under \"Theft\", \"Assault\", \"Drug/Narcotic,\" or \"other\". An example of how this prediction  could help in the future is to allocate enough law enforcement at the right place and right time to prevent the three classifications. Through some feataure engineering, I'll keep the columns, \"X\", \"Y\", \"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\",\"Hour\", and \"Minute\", and \"DayInNumber\". Finally, I will use random forests as suggested by Ivan as the variables are likely to not be linear. "
